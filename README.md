# advent_code_test
This repo contains solutions to the first 4 levels of Advent of Code problems.

Each level corresponds to a "day". To run a given level, simply execute:

``python day_<LevelNumber>.py``

For example, for Level 1:

``python day_1.py``

P.S.: This code avoids using any libraries such as NumPy and relies only on basic Python operations.
